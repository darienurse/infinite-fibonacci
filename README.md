# infinite-fibonacci
A simple android app that generates an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers. Since this series of numbers infinite, the values will overflow at some point. When this happens, overflow values will appear in red. Even though these values are now meaningless, the user can still finitely scroll through the list.

The InfiniteScrollListener Class was borrowed from Panos Papageorgiou. Source code can be found at http://www.avocarrot.com/blog/implement-infinitely-scrolling-list-android/
